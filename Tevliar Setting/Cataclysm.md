The Caster can invoke a chaotic cataclysmic event, causing a random destructive effect in a 60-foot radius around the caster. Roll a d4 to determine the effect:

1. Fury of the Elements: A tempest of fire, water, and lightning erupts, dealing 21(6d6) fire, 21(6d6) cold, and 21(6d6) lightning damage to all creatures that either enter the area for the first time on their turn or start their turn in the area. The Creature may make a dexterity saving throw taking half damage on a success. The area of the spell is difficult terrain and heavily obscures creatures within. This effect lasts for up to 1 minute unless the caster dispels it early.

2. Spatial Distortion: The space within the area warps, causing all creatures to be randomly teleported to different locations within the area. They may make a Wisdom saving throw to resist the teleportation.

3. Entropic Chaos: Reality becomes unstable, and all creatures in the area have their hit point maximum reduced by 44 (8d10) for 1 hour. The creature may make a Charisma saving throw to negate this effect.

4. Chaos Infusion: The Caster absorbs the chaos from the surroundings, healing for 77 hit points and gaining temporary hit points equal to the hit points recovered.
