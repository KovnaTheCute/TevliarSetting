You decide that maybe something shouldn’t exist. You can remove anything and or everything inside of a 500ft radius around you, this can include things such as the ground, air, living creatures, etc. You have complete control over what is erased and what remains. Everything that you choose to affect simply ceases to exist, it doesn’t go anywhere, it can’t be recovered, it’s just gone.
