Casting time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Tumors grow through your skin into a creature that you're touching, taking root as a parasitic entity inside their body. The creature is struck with an incurable disease and will die in 7 days. The creature becomes resistant to all forms of damage and immune to other diseases and the poisoned condition and damage. The infected creature does not need to eat, drink, or sleep. This disease only spreads if parts of the creature (or fluids) are consumed by another creature. In this case the new creature contracts the disease and shares all effects of this spell. This does not affect the original creature (outside of the effects of, y’know, being eaten). You may have beaten stage 4 cancer, but can you beat Goku?

This spell doesn’t work on constructs, unknown, or undead.
