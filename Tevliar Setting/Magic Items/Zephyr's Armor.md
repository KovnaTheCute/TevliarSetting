#MagicItem 
Wondrous item (circlet), very rare (requires attunement by a monk)
Cost: 22,000gp
This ethereal, translucent armor appears as a shimmering aura that flows with the monk’s movements like a breeze. It doesn’t cover the body like traditional armor but instead forms a protective shield of wind and air, wrapping the wearer in the power of the storm that stems from the circlet. The armor gives the wearer a feeling of weightlessness and speed, as though they are one with the wind itself.

Properties:

**AC Bonus.** When calculating AC with Unarmored defense while attuned to Zephyr’s Armor, the base value is changed from 10 to 16.

**Windborne Movement.** Your movement speed increases by 20 feet. Additionally, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action.

**Sonic Boom Strike.** Once per short rest, when you make an unarmed strike, you can activate Zephyr’s power to unleash a sonic boom. The strike deals an additional 3d6 thunder damage, and all creatures within 10 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier). On a failed save, a creature takes full damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and is not deafened.

**Zephyr’s Grace.** While wearing Zephyr’s Armor, you can use your reaction to reduce falling damage to zero. Additionally, you can move through difficult terrain without expending extra movement, as the wind aids your steps.

**Tornado Step.** Once per long rest, as an action, you can create a swirling vortex of wind around you, allowing you to move at incredible speeds. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:
- You gain a flying speed equal to your movement speed.
- Your movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.
- All attacks you make with unarmed strikes deal an additional 1d6 thunder damage.
    
**Whirlwind Rush.** When you take the Dash action, you can choose to create a gust of wind that pushes your enemies aside. All creatures in a 10-foot line in front of you must make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.
