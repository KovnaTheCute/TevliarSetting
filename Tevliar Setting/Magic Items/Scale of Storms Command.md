Cost: 16,000gp
Requires attunement by a creature with an intelligence score of 13 or higher.

The Scale of Stormâ€™s Command is a powerful amulet crafted from a blue dragons scale, polished to a sheen and encased in mithril. The scale feels warm to the touch and faintly hums when lightning is near. When activated small arcs of electricity dance across its surface, illuminating the wearer in a faint glow. While wearing the amulet, you gain resistance to lightning damage and advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks in storms or windy conditions.

As a bonus action, you can emit a pulse of lightning energy in a 10 ft. radius. Each creature of your choice in the area takes 2d6 lighting damage. You can use this ability three times per long rest.

Once per long rest, you can cast Command (DC 15) using the amulet.
