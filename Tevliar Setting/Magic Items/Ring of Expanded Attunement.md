#MagicItem 
Wondrous item (ring), Legendary, 
Cost: 75,000 gp
This finely crafted golden ring is engraved with intricate runes that hum softly with latent magic. While wearing this ring, you can attune to one additional magic item beyond the standard limit of three. The ring itself does not require attunement, allowing its effect to stack with other rings and items the wearer chooses to attune to.

The following conditions apply to the ringâ€™s use:
- Strain of Attunement: If the ring is removed, you must immediately end attunement to one other magic item if the number of attuned items exceeds three.
- Aura Interference: This ring cannot function if the wearer possesses or is attuned to another item that provides additional attunement slots.
- Cumulative Burden: Wielding more than three attuned items may strain lesser mortals. While wearing this ring and attuned to more than three items, non-legendary creatures have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws against exhaustion.
