Deity level necromancy
Casting time: 1 action
Range: 500 ft.
Components V
Duration: Instantaneous
Necrotic threads weave a net around you in a 500ft radius, snaring every soul it can and forcing them under your servitude. Every dead creature within a 1 mile radius of you is resurrected as a zombie or skeleton regardless of how long theyâ€™ve been dead, what the creature is, or how willing they are to return. If only part of a creature remains (bone fragments for example) then enough of a body for the creature to perform basic functions is formed around the part. If the creatures soul is trapped either by magic or on another plane it is ripped out from wherever it is (unless held by another deity level spell) and forced into its body. Creatures resurrected this way remain under the casters service until they cannot any longer such as when they are killed again or when they are released.
