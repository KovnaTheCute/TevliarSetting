A portal to a plane unknown to even the gods, the source of their powers. The sentient creature chosen by the caster disintegrates, their mass reforming into an elegant archway inscribed with indecipherable runes. For the next two hours a portal is formed within the archway that leads to the edge. The portal is two ways and is unaffected by anti magic spells. When the spell ends the portal collapses, reforming into an ancient guardian imbued with the power of the edge.
