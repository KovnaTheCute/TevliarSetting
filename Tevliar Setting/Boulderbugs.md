**Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1.

**Age.** Boulderbugs do not suffer greatly from the ravages of time; indeed, rather than weakening, they slowly grow ever-larger as the centuries pass. Eventually, after around eight hundred years or so, the energy required to molt their shell and grow larger is too much for the Boulderbug to survive. Young Boukderbugs mature rapidly, becoming fully functioning adults—albeit rather small—within a year of hatching.

**Alignment.** Boulderbugs are more than happy to curl into their shells and ignore everything around them. They enjoy the simple things and dislike rapid change that catches them off guard. Most are neutral, acting to the benefit of the colony while still prioritizing their own comfort. Very few become adventurers, those who do being generally lawful. It’s almost unheard of for a Boulderbug to become evil.

**Size.** Boulderbugs stand 5 to 6 feet tall and average 300 pounds. Their shells account for roughly one third of their weight. Your size is medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Benthic Adaptation.** You can breath underwater, and you do not suffer damage or penalties from pressure in the deeps. You gain no particular skill in swimming, however; your people keep to the oozing muck and tumbled ruins upon the ocean’s floor.

**Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Natural Armor.** Due to your shell and the shape of your body, you are ill-suited to wearing armor. Your shell provides ample protection, however; it gives you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal.

**Shell Defense.** You can withdraw into your shell as an action. Until you emerge, you gain a +4 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While in your shell, you are a small creature, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, you can't take reactions, and the only action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell.

**Scavenger Stomach.** You gain proficiency in constitution saving throws and are immune to poisons that are ingested. You can not become diseased from rotten food and you can eat any decaying matter.

**Frankly Repulsive.** You gain proficiency with the Intimidate skill.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Boulderbug.
