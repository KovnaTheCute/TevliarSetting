**Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1.

**Age.** Boulderbug young lack the patterns that mature Boulderbugs have, otherwise they appear as smaller versions of adults. Boulderbugs reach adulthood by the age of 2 and live an average of 5 years.

**Alignment.** Boulderbugs are more than happy to curl into their shells and ignore everything around them. They enjoy the simple things and dislike rapid change that catches them off guard. Most are neutral, acting to the benefit of the colony while still prioritizing their own comfort. Very few become adventurers, those who do being generally lawful. Itâ€™s almost unheard of for a Boulderbug to become evil.

**Size.** Boulderbugs stand 5 to 6 feet tall and average 300 pounds. Their shells account for roughly one third of their weight. Your size is medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Natural Armor.** Due to your shell and the shape of your body, you are ill-suited to wearing armor. Your shell provides ample protection, however; it gives you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal.

**Shell Defense.** You can withdraw into your shell as an action. Until you emerge, you gain a +4 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While in your shell, you are prone, your speed is 0 and can't increase, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, you can't take reactions, and the only action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell.

**Scavenger Stomach.** You gain proficiency in constitution saving throws and are immune to poisons that are ingested. You can not become diseased from rotten food and you can eat any decaying matter.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Boulderbug.
