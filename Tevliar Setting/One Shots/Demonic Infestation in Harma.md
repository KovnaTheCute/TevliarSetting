# Part 1
**The Beginning:** The Players find themselves inside one of the many taverns inside of the city of [[Harma]]. As adventurers they have basic access to the city, the upper floors. They have received a request to seek out a suspected cult that is taking place somewhere within the city. Their goal is to discover where and to snuff it out.

**Sources of Information:** There are three main ways the players may be able to find the cult.
- By getting the information from the inn keep, many rumors swirl through the taverns and the one they're at has heard a few about the cult they're tracking. This is the fastest way of finding the cult but is difficult to get out of the traditionalist inn keep.
- By investigating one of the sacrifice scenes and tracking some of the evidence left behind (Dagger, Hair, Blood, Etc.). This investigation leads them to where a dwarf was kidnapped, not the summoning site but the location is stored on a map on one of the kidnapper cultists.
- Through a general sweep of the city. Several hours of searching will reveal a shadowy figure or a rumor that they can follow. If they all search as one large group it takes 12 hours. Individually that time is divided by the number of searching parties. This will make the combat significantly harder as the cult will have finished summoning the Corrupter and it will have already settled in.

**Cult Location:** The Cult is located on one of the outer streets of 

# Part 2
**Infiltration of the Cult:** The cultists are not accepting new members, all the fanatics in the group are aware of this fact however the lesser members are not and are easier to deceive. The cult is in the act of summoning a group of demons and needs to do it within the city for easy access to sacrifices. They have very specific criteria, requiring both steam spirits and life of good souls. Their goal is to amass a large amount of demons and set them loose within the city, distracting the military for long enough to slink into deeper sectors.

**Number of Cultists:** There are two clockwork hulks standing guard at the door, cultists may occasionally move in and out of the building however there's always roughly 20 of them in the room at any given time. The cult leader is always inside overseeing the preparation, and there are four cult fanatics that are preparing for the ritual.

**Before the Summoning:** The cult is spending the day preparing for the ritual, however if they are found out they can begin the ritual early, this poses a risk as there may be a chance for the ritual to fail.

**During the summoning:** The fanatics are in a constant state of  maintaining an abyssal portal. 4 Fanatics stand chanting, if even one is left in their summoning place the portal remains open. The fanatics remain chanting even after being killed, only stopping after they are removed from their ritual spot. If pushed they will do anything to force their way back into the spot. At the start of each round each fanatic accrues 1 summoning token towards the total. Once the total reaches 4 the portal is large enough for demons to start coming through, 2d4 twisted wretches come through at the start of each round. Once the total reaches 12 the portal is substantial enough for the corrupter that had been manipulating the cult makes its appearance.

**Behavior of Demons:** The twisted wretches attack cultists and players alike, merely engaging the nearest target but prioritizing the players if they're present. The corruptor quickly corrupts the remaining fanatics. immediately turning them into twisted wretches. It then turns its focus to killing the party and possessing the rest of the cultists.
