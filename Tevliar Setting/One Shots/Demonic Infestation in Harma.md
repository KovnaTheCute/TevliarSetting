# Part 1
**The Beginning:** The Players find themselves inside one of the many taverns inside of the city of [[Harma]]. As adventurers they have basic access to the city, the basic floors. They have received a request to seek out a suspected cult that is taking place somewhere within the city. Their goal is to discover where and to snuff it out.

**Sources of Information:** There are three main ways the players may be able to find the cult.
- By investigating one of the sacrifice scenes and tracking some of the evidence left behind (Dagger, Hair, Blood, Etc.)
- By getting the information from the inn keep, many rumors swirl through the taverns and the one they're at has heard a few about the cult they're tracking.
- Through a general sweep of the city. Several hours of searching will reveal a shadowy figure that they can follow. If they all search as one large group it takes 12 hours. Individulaly
