Two parts to the quest
- Part 1: Role Play to find the cult
- Part 2: Infiltrate and Slaughter of the cult (Potential Role play/Combat)

# Part 1
**The Beginning:** The Players find themselves inside one of the many taverns inside of the city of [[Harma]]. As adventurers they have basic access to the city, the upper floors. They have received a request to seek out a suspected cult that is taking place somewhere within the city. Their goal is to discover where and to snuff it out.

**Sources of Information:** There are three main ways the players may be able to find the cult.
- By getting the information from the inn keep, many rumors swirl through the taverns and the one they're at has heard a few about the cult they're tracking. This is the fastest way of finding the cult but is difficult to get out of the traditionalist inn keep.
- By investigating one of the sacrifice scenes and tracking some of the evidence left behind (Dagger, Hair, Blood, Etc.). This investigation leads them to where a dwarf was kidnapped, not the summoning site but the location is stored on a map on one of the kidnapper cultists. This takes longer then interrogating the inn keep and gives the cultists time to gather in a larger number.
- Through a general sweep of the city. Several hours of searching will reveal a shadowy figure that they can follow. If they all search as one large group it takes 12 hours. Individually that time is divided by the number of searching parties. This will make the combat significantly harder as the cult will have finished summoning all the demons and the Corrupter will have already settled in.

# Part 2
**Infiltration of the Cult:** The cultists are not accepting new members, all the fanatics in the group are aware of this fact however the lesser members are not and are easier to deceive. The cult is in the act of summoning a group of demons and needs to do it within the city for easy access to sacrifices. They have very specific criteria, requiring both steam spirits and pure individuals whom have never killed or lied. Their goal is to amass a large amount of demons and set them loose within the city, distracting the military for long enough to slink into deeper sectors.

**Number of Cultists:** The time at which the cult is discovered determines the number of cultists and the stage of summoning. Finding the cult quickly (Through the Inn Keep) discovers the cult as they are preparing. Only 4 fanatics, the leader, and roughly 10 cultists are present, however they also have the help of a clockwork hulk as they haven't harvested the steam spirit yet. Finding the cult at a moderate time discovers the cult during the summoning. This is the largest gathering and finds 4 fanatics, the leader, and around 20 cultists in attendance. Finding the cult after the summoning leads to the corruptor being settled in. The cultists are either slaughtered or corrupted and the room is pitch dark.

**Before the Summoning:** Until the portal is opened there is a reprogramed clockwork hulk at standby, it follows all commands from the fanatics or leader. Once the portal is activated the stream spirit within the hulk is destroyed and the hulk is deactivated. A new steam spirit could inhabit the hulk as it is still operational.

**During the summoning:** The fanatics are in a constant state of  maintaining an abyssal portal. It takes 4 cultist fanatics to maintain the portal through verbal chant and the other cultists will sacrifice themselves to protect these fanatics at any cost. Demons pour through the portal at the end of each round as determined by the table below.

| Round | Demons                  |
| ----- | ----------------------- |
| 1     | 6 Maw Demon             |
| 2     | The Portal Grows Larger |
| 3     | 2 Abyssal Scavengers    |
| 4     | 3 Abyssal Scavengers    |
| 5     | The portal grows larger |
| 6     | Corrupter               |

**Behavior of Demons:**
- The maw demons attack the nearest prey, regardless of what it is.
- The abyssal scavengers are intelligent enough to not attack the fanatics but once they start attacking they wont discriminate between cultist and adventurer
- The corrupter is intelligent enough to specifically target the players however the first beings that it corrupts are the fanatics keeping the portal open which closes the portal and cuts off additional demons
