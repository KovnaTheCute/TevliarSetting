#MagicItem 
Legendary Amulet, Requires Attunement

Price: 50,000–75,000 gp

This sinister amulet features a dark, swirling gem encased in jagged black metal, its edges sharp enough to suggest malice. The gem hums with latent power and exudes a palpable aura of dread, promising devastating abilities to its bearer at a significant cost.
