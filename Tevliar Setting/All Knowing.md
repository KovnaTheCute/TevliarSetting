Pure power flows through your touch enlightening any creature with knowledge of any answer to any question in existence. Upon touching a creature that creature can receive the answers to three of their questions, these answers are 100% honest and always correct. If there is more then one answer to a question then the best answer will be chosen or all the answers will be presented. Some questions have incomprehensible answers that no mortal mind can withstand, if one of these questions is answered then the creature who posed the question takes 10d10 psychic damage and cannot communicate through any means other then gibberish for 1d12 days.
