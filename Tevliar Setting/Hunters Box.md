The Hunter's Box is a simple, practical wooden container with modest carvings of arrows and deer running in a herd. The box weighs 15 pounds regardless of its contents.Â 

When the bearer touches the carcass of a dead creature with the box, the carcass is magically transported inside. The box has a capacity to hold up to 1,000lbs of material. Stored carcasses remain in pristine condition, unaffected by decay, spoilage, or scavengers while inside. The box is limited to storing the remains of non-sentient creatures, such as beasts, and cannot store constructs, undead, or sentient creatures of any kind.

The bearer can use an action to retrieve any stored carcass, which appears in an unoccupied, adjacent space. If there is insufficient room for the carcass to emerge, the attempt fails. Should the box exceed its storage limit, its magical properties fail, and all stored carcasses spill out into the nearest available spaces. The box also cannot be placed inside an extradimensional space, such as a Bag of Holding or Handy Haversack. If this is attempted, both items lose their magical properties and expel their contents into the surrounding area.
