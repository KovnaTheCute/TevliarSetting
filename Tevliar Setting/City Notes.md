## [[Bellwash]]
- Capital of the [[Kingdom of Belldonia]], Bellwash is the major trade center of the continent. It's in a central location and has one of the strongest military forces backing it.
- If you need to obtain or sell something, it can almost always be done in Bellwash, anything goes in the massive public market for one with a keen enough eye and deep enough connections. 

## [[Wizandra]]
- One of the major cities in the Belldonian empire, Wizandra the city magic. Wizandra houses the prestigious school of magic, the highest tier of the city. The middle tier provides housing for nobles and upper society along with resources for adventurers, be it pubs and inns or shops selling magic items and trinkets. The market caters towards rare alchemical resources, myriads of magical tools, trinkets and weapons, and various mythical familiars captured from remote locals.
- The third layer of Wizandra is known only by the highest ranking nobles and the two current leaders of Belldonia. Depp beneath the ground in the underdark slaves are transported, bred, and sacrificed to a captured young devourer of magic, the source of the controlled anti magic field around Wizandra. This is the cause of [[The Hunt]] that takes place each year by the university. Wizandra is a city of study first and formost and even the kings have little power to stop the slavery needed for study and maintenence.
- Wizandra built and maintains the regulations around teleportation circles, using magic harvested from the devourer to power it.

## [[Devils Perch]]
- A northern stronghold city sitting in the deepest part of the [[Demonic Wastes]]. Operated by devils and mainly populated by Tieflings.

- Several [[Arch Demons]] are housed within the stronghold city, some with more freedom then others.
