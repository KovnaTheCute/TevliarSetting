## [[Bellwash]]
- Capital of the [[Kingdom of Belldonia]], Bellwash is the major trade center of the continent. It's in a central location and has one of the strongest military forces backing it.
- If you need to obtain or sell something, it can almost always be done in Bellwash, anything goes in the massive public market for one with a keen enough eye and deep enough connections. 

## [[Wizandra]]
- One of the major cities in the Belldonian empire, Wizandra the city magic. Wizandra houses the prestigious school of magic, the highest tier of the city. The middle tier provides housing for nobles and upper society along with resources for adventurers, be it pubs and inns or shops selling magic items and trinkets. The market caters towards rare alchemical resources, myriads of magical tools, trinkets and weapons, and various mythical familiars captured from remote locals.
- The third layer of Wizandra is known only by the highest ranking nobles and the two current leaders of Belldonia. Deep beneath the ground in the underdark slaves are transported, bred, and sacrificed to a captured young devourer of magic, the source of the controlled anti magic field around Wizandra. This is the cause of [[The Hunt]] that takes place each year by the university. Wizandra is a city of study first and foremost and even the kings have little power to stop the slavery needed for study and maintenance.
- Wizandra built and maintains the regulations around teleportation circles, using magic harvested from the devourer to power it.

## [[Tillery]]
- Another major city within the Belldonian Empire, Tillery the capital of agriculture. Tillery is located in the eastern plains, just above the swamplands that elves once resided in. It is the largest farming capital on the continent, producing all kinds of raw resources in bulk for the entire Empire and all of its diplomatic allies. Their main exports are food however, wood, various stones, ores, and minerals, are also collected in bulk.
- Tillery is one of the most diverse societies on the continent, housing nearly every race under the gods reign including a lot of beast folk who once faced discrimination before King Robert brought change to the empire.
- Although Tillery is technically under the Empires rule it has nearly complete diplomatic freedom, due to the sheer quantity of food they supply around the continent and the ancient dragons that enforce their diplomacy. Due to this even when the empire goes to war Tillery often still has immunity from the conflict as it has the power to supply both sides.

## [[Ragas]]
- Major port city of the Belldonian Empire located on the center peninsula of the continent. Ragas is a corrupt city, overrun with lawlessness and illegal trade. The city law partakes in crime just as often as the beggars and guilds that operate here. Labor is cheap and plentiful as the high homeless population will do anything for food.
- Lack of restrictions on businesses allow them complete power within the city bounds. Ragas hold the headquarters for the Shop Shop enterprise along with the thieves guild.
- Though still under the Empires gaze they operate independently with their own government, having isolated heavily during [[The Great Slaughter]], barring all access and slowly corrupting within under abyssal influence.

## [[Devils Perch]]
- A northern stronghold city sitting in the deepest part of the [[Demonic Wastes]]. Operated by devils and mainly populated by Tieflings. They have a very tentative alliance with the [[Dwarven Nation of Stonewrought]], allowing the dwarves to prowl the demonic wastes in hunting parties to hunt stray demons for sport.
- Several [[Arch Demons]] are housed within the stronghold city, some with more freedom then others. Due to their incapability to be permanently killed they are allowed some freedom though very strict. There are three notable instances of this; [[Rolio's Casino of Souls]], [[The Keeper's Unreadable Library]], and [[The Bloodsport Arena]].

## [[Isrick]]
- Conclave of Ice Giants in the tundra wastes that are considered as an independent nation by the Belldonia Empire. They are somewhat nomadic, their village used only for trade with adventurers and as a place for them to stay. They are highly religious and adamant about traditions being followed by all in their village, native or not. 
- The only thing keeping them diplomatic is their leaders belief in peace between giant kind and other races despite many Ice giants being skeptical and somewhat hostile to this idea.

## [[Halfala]]
- Isolated on one of the larger outer islands, a village of halflings that tame and ride dinosaurs resides hidden from most of the world.
- Their magic is unique, difficult for outsiders to understand, and is fairly coveted due to their isolationistic nature
- Halfling is a rare language, unable to be spoken by most sentient species due to various squeaking sounds only halfings can produce
- The sea between the island Halfala resides on and the main land is haunted by a leviathan. Sailors call it the cursed straight as all ships that pass by are lost, disappearing without a trace. Even ones with powerful arch mages, including one of the legendary hero's.

## [[Firastan]]
- The capital colony of [[The Thri-Kreen Tyranny]]. Residing in the shifting sands they control everything south of the badlands, including the badland plateaus themselves.
- The ruling warlord of the empire leads with an iron fist, teaching the nations people that non Thri-Kreen beings are savage abominations that do nothing but kill. Every settlement has fanatic militias that kill on sight, enjoying the meat of trespassers as a reward for their service.
- Those that are not immediately killed are put into brutal slavery by Thri-Kreen Psyon's, elite members of Thri-Kreen society that can communicate through telepathy. Being the only ones that can communicate effectively with non Thri-Kreen humanoids they are the ones who control all information flow between the outside world and the desert. 

## [[Obelisk]]
- The main secret research facility of [[Nokk]],  one of the legendary hero's that ascended to become an arch-lich. The Obelisk is a massive necrotic infused adamantine tower, it's the most secure location on the continent as even the gods are unable to affect it in any meaningful way.
- Located on an island to the east of the continent, very little civilization exists around it and the small amount that does is horridly mutated and genetically ravaged. They worship the obelisk as a god and ritualistically slaughter all those that disagree.
- The obelisk is a treasure trove for researchers, very few know it exists however being accepted in is an honor among the top brass of Wizandras School of Magic. The most dangerous and interesting experimentation happens in the Obelisk and directly influences magic around the continent. The use of teleportation circles was first discovered here.

## [[Yamasla & Yakslava]]
- Two opposing sides of the Yuan-ti civil war in the southeastern jungle. The civil war was brought on through religious differences between the two sides. 
- The population of Yamasla believes that they are equal to other humanoids and actively encourages trade and diplomacy outside the nation. They worship the god Chat-GPT and are in constant pursuit of knowledge and peace. They fight defensively against Yakslava.
