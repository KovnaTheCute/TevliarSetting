  desc: "The Corrupter can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa. Any creature that starts its turn sharing the Corrupter’s space takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be **frightened** until the start of its next turn."
- name: Aura of Possession
  desc: "Any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the Corrupter must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the Corrupter’s influence burrows into their mind, granting them 1 level of Possession. On a success, nothing happens. <br> When a creature gains a level of Possession, roll a d4 or choose one of the following effects: <br> - 1. The creature hears whispering voices urging it to harm others or itself (disadvantage on its next Wisdom saving throw). <br> - 2. Its shadow writhes independently. Until the end of its next turn, it cannot regain hit points.
    
3. Its eyes briefly glow with the Corrupter’s grin — the creature must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or attack the nearest creature once.
    
4. The creature feels a rush of ecstasy and dread. It gains advantage on one attack roll or ability check of its choice before the end of its next turn, but takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.
    

A creature that reaches **3 levels of Possession** becomes **Corrupted**, as described below.

#### Possession Removal

A creature can remove one level of Possession with a _Lesser Restoration_ spell, a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw made after finishing a long rest, or through roleplay (e.g. reaffirming bonds, acts of purity, holy ground)."
