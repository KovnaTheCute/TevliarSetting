  desc: "The Corrupter can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa. Any creature that starts its turn sharing the Corrupter’s space takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be **frightened** until the start of its next turn."
- name: Aura of Possession
  desc: "Any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the Corrupter must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the Corrupter’s influence burrows into their mind, granting them 1 level of Possession. On a success, nothing happens. <br> When a creature gains a level of Possession, roll a d4 or choose one of the following effects: <br> - 1. The creature hears whispering voices urging it to harm others or itself (disadvantage on its next Wisdom saving throw). <br> - 2. Its shadow writhes independently. Until the end of its next turn, it cannot regain hit points. <br> - 3. Its eyes briefly glow with the Corrupter’s grin — the creature must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or attack the nearest creature once. <br> - 4. The creature feels a rush of ecstasy and dread. It gains advantage on one attack roll or ability check of its choice before the end of its next turn, but takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. <br> A creature can remove one level of Possession with a Lesser Restoration spell, a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw made after finishing a long rest, or through roleplay (e.g. reaffirming bonds, acts of purity, holy ground). If the Corrupter is slain or banished, any possessed creature immediately loses one level of Possession per round until fully freed."

  desc: "At the start of its turn, spectral rats pour from beneath the Corrupter’s cloak. Each creature of its choice within 15 feet must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 9 (2d8) necrotic damage and gain 1 level of Possession as the spirits gnaw at their mind."

On a success the creature resists but is stunned until the end of its next turn as their body spasms. On a failure the Corrupter’s shadow engulfs them the creature becomes a Twisted Servant, an undead-fiend hybrid under the Corrupter’s control."

### Description:
At first glance, a Corrupter might seem almost passive compared to other demons. It drifts soundlessly through the air, draped in a tattered black cloak that seems to drink the light around it. Yet beneath that cloak lies no flesh — only void. From that emptiness pour spectral rats that scatter through the air, phantasmal carriers of madness and disease. And beneath the hood, there is only a grin: wide, white, and impossibly still.

**Sowers of Madness:** Unlike most demons, Corrupters do not rampage openly. They are patient predators of the mind. When they enter a mortal settlement, they hide in the shadows, whispering to the lonely, the angry, and the desperate. Their words are promises — _“They don’t understand you. You deserve better. You could be free.”_ — and their whispers gnaw like vermin, feeding on guilt and fear until their victims are hollowed out from within.

Those who listen too long begin to change. Their shadows twist unnaturally, their smiles linger too wide, and eventually their bodies warp as the Corrupter’s essence claims them. These broken beings, known as Twisted Servants, become living extensions of the demon’s will — hollow shells of what they once were.

**Temptation as a Weapon:** Corrupters are known to offer _boons_ to mortals who accept their presence willingly. A whisper of power, a fleeting surge of strength — all in exchange for a moment of surrender. The willing are taken first, their souls willingly pried open, for consent makes corruption all the sweeter.

Even adventurers can feel the pull — promises of forbidden strength, of control, of peace from the pain of their mortal lives. Many a hero’s downfall began not with a blade, but with a whisper.

**Feeding on Despair:** Corrupters delight in suffering. When they invade a community, they strike from the shadows, turning friend against friend, sowing paranoia until the survivors are forced to witness their loved ones’ transformation. Only when all hope is gone does the Corrupter reveal itself fully — a towering shape wreathed in shrieking shadows, its grin the last thing its victims see before they join its swarm.

**DM’s Note:**
The Corrupter is best used as a psychological horror villain, the unseen manipulator behind a village’s downfall, or the voice in the adventurers’ dreams. Its real strength lies not in combat, but in slow corruption over time.
- Introduce it through atmosphere first: dead rats, strange laughter, friends acting oddly.
- Let players slowly accrue Possession levels over several sessions — not just encounters — using dreams, whispers, and fleeting hallucinations.
- Give them the choice to resist or give in. Maybe the Corrupter offers real help once or twice (“I can save them… just say _yes_.”).
- When they finally confront it, make the battle feel personal — each player fighting not only the fiend, but the shadow of their own fears.
If you want to emphasize tragedy, allow one NPC or even a former ally to have become a Twisted Servant, recognizable only by a broken grin and eyes that no longer see.

The corruptor is extremely dangerous due to its possession mechanic and should only be used when you are prepared to have a PC die. If you want to run the stat block without that risk simply build possession without possessing the players.

With the possession trait of whispers passing the player characters notes or actually giving them lines from the corruptor offering help, power, or promises is a really powerful narrative hook and could potentially turn the players against one another. The corruptor is willing to grant these promises however it savors the twisted fulfilment like a genie (Offers to help a cleric find those who need healing, fulfils this by turning the cleric into a blood thirsty twisted wretch. Helping the cleric find those in need of healing through creating the wounds that need to be healed)
