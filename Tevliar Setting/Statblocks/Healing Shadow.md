### Description:
Unlike their hateful kin, healing shadows are born from rare necromantic accidents or deliberate infusions of restorative magic. Where ordinary shadows hunger for life, these creatures cherish it, wandering the world with quiet purpose. Their bodies retain the familiar silhouette of their kind, but a faint violet hue shimmers in their outline, a glimmer that betrays their benevolent intent.

**Light in Darkness.** Healing shadows often dwell in the same places as normal shadows — ancient tombs, cursed ruins, or sites of necromantic power — but their behavior sets them apart. Instead of ambushing the living, they drift toward them, seeking out the wounded, the weary, and the lost. Their touch, once a drain upon life, now restores vitality. Yet this gift is easily misunderstood; adventurers stumbling into a shadow-haunted crypt may destroy a healing shadow before realizing its nature.

**Gentle Guardians.** Though they cannot speak, healing shadows sometimes linger near mortals, watching over them in silence. They seem to favor children, the gravely injured, and those struggling with despair. In rare cases, they have been known to form bonds with adventurers who show them kindness, serving as unseen allies in times of need. Many sages believe these spirits are driven by the remnants of their mortal selves, granted a second chance through the mingling of necromancy and mercy.

  

**Dungeon Master’s Note:** 
Healing shadows are an excellent way to surprise your players with a twist on expectations. Introduce them subtly in areas already haunted by normal shadows — perhaps one lingers in the corner, watching quietly, or perhaps its violet shimmer catches the eye during combat. If your players attack them without hesitation, the lesson is harsh: sometimes not everything in a dungeon is an enemy.

You can use healing shadows as allies, quest rewards, or moral challenges. They can save an unconscious adventurer from certain death, guide a party to safety, or serve as spectral companions to those who earn their trust. Just as easily, they can serve as a tragic reminder of good misunderstood — a creature of kindness cut down in fear.
