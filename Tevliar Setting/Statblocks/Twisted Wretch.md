### Description:
The Twisted Wretch is a grotesque remnant of a mortal body and soul overtaken by abyssal corruption. Its flesh is warped into unnatural shapes, oozing black ichor that burns like acid upon contact. Jagged claws tear at anything nearby while its hollow eyes glimmer with dim, hateful light. Though it still carries the faint echo of the person it once was, that humanity has been drowned beneath endless, whispering rage.

**Born of Corruption:** A Twisted Wretch begins as a mortal consumed by exposure to concentrated abyssal energy—whether through cursed artifacts, demonic possession, or the lingering touch of an Abyssal Rift. The corruption tears away the subject’s will and identity, molding flesh and spirit alike into a vessel of spite and suffering. The transformation is agonizing and often lasts days, during which the victim’s screams echo through the air until their voice breaks into an inhuman rasp.

**Echoes of the Damned:** Despite being stripped of coherent thought, fragments of memory remain within the Wretch’s ruined mind. It may mutter broken phrases, reach toward objects that once held meaning, or freeze when hearing a familiar melody. To those who knew the victim in life, such behavior can be more horrifying than the monster’s violence—a grim reminder that the person still suffers, trapped within their own defiled flesh.

**Abyssal Contagion:** The corruption that fuels a Twisted Wretch is self-propagating. Where its blood spills, vegetation blackens and animals grow restless. Corpse-rats and carrion flies are drawn to its remains, often mutating into warped forms themselves. Left unchecked, even a single Wretch can seed a spreading blight of demonic influence that transforms entire regions into warped reflections of the Abyss.

**DM Note:**
The Twisted Wretch is most effective as a psychological and environmental threat rather than just a brawler. Its mix of resistances and reactive necrotic damage makes it a strong mid-tier encounter, especially when used in confined or corrupted spaces. Use the Abyssal Husk explosion to punish reckless melee engagement or to heighten tension in close-quarters fights.

For narrative use, the Wretch works beautifully as a fallen villager, guard, or even ally —someone the players once knew, now turned by corruption. This twist can deliver emotional weight and foreshadow the presence of a greater demonic entity or spreading Abyssal influence. If used alongside other demonic creatures, it serves as a bridge between the mortal world and the full horrors of the Abyss—a tragic, writhing warning of what’s to come.
