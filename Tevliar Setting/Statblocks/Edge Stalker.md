  desc: "The Edge Stalker can shift its combat abilities using a bonus action, choosing one of the following adaptations: <br> Static of the Edge <br> - All of the Edge Stalkers damage becomes psychic damage. When a creature starts their turn within 60ft. of the Edge Stalker they must succeed a DC 18 Wisdom save or take 11 (2d10) psychic damage. In addition all creatures within the radius have disadvantage on all saving throws. <br> - The edge stalker regains hit points equal to half of the psychic damage it deals up to a maximum of 20 per turn. <br> Bladestorm <br> - When a creature makes a melee attack against the Edge Stalker they must succeed a DC 18 Dexterity check or fail the attack automatically. <br> - When the Edge Stalker deals damage with an attack the creature loses an additional 5(1d10) hitpoints at the start of each of their turns due to blood loss. The creature can use its action to attempt a DC 18 Constitution check, ending the effect on a success. <br> Pinpoint Precision <br> - The Edge Stalker gains +5 to hit when making attacks and crits on rolls of 18 - 20 <br> - When the Edge Stalker makes an attack it ignores disadvantage caused by range, if a creature is hit by an attack the creature must succeed a DC 18 constitution save or become incapacitated. The creature can remake this save at the end of each turn, ending the effect on a success. A creature that has succeeded the save within the last 24 hours is stunned instead of incapacitated."

### Description:
Edge Stalkers are assassins of the Edge, denizens of the void between universes. Even gods tread lightly in their presence, for these beings hunt with unparalleled precision and lethality. From a distance, an Edge Stalker may appear humanoid, even mundane, but the closer one approaches, the more the truth becomes apparent: its flesh flickers with shifting masses, its body phasing in and out of reality. Faceless and nameless, they are individuals only in form; kill one, and it dissipates, leaving no corpse behind.

**Alien Predators.** Edge Stalkers are creatures beyond comprehension. Their motives are inscrutable, their payments abstract or bizarre. Some have been known to hunt for trivialities, like apples or a single lock of hair, while others seek only the thrill of the hunt. They are indifferent to morality, allegiance, or reason—loyal only to the contracts they accept, and even then, only in the manner they deem sufficient.

**Masters of the Hunt.** These beings are expert predators, blending supernatural mobility, phasing capabilities, and reality-altering attacks. They can choose adaptations suited to the battlefield, turning damage psychic, inflicting relentless bleeding, or striking with surgical precision. In combat, an Edge Stalker is as likely to vanish mid-strike as it is to appear out of nowhere, leaving opponents disoriented and terrified.

**Faceless Hunters.** Edge Stalkers operate alone or in small groups. Even in numbers, they are unpredictable, striking swiftly and silently. They exist in the spaces that mortals—and even many immortals—cannot safely traverse, and encounters with them are often catastrophic. Legends tell of gods felled in secluded moments by these predators, and of armies that vanished before even seeing them.

**DM Note.** Edge Stalkers are best used sparingly, as apex predators of high-magic or high-tier campaigns. Their abilities make them perfect for assassination encounters, sudden ambushes, or as enigmatic villains whose motives remain unknown. They can phase through walls, teleport in darkness, and adapt to the combat environment, making traditional tactics ineffective. When designing encounters, consider their intelligence and unpredictability: they may retreat, feint, or manipulate the battlefield before engaging in direct combat. Use them to instill a sense of alien danger, where the rules of reality themselves seem malleable.
