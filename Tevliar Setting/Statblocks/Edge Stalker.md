  desc: "The Edge Stalker can shift its combat abilities using a bonus action, choosing one of the following adaptations: <br> Static of the Edge <br> - All of the Edge Stalkers damage becomes psychic damage. When a creature starts their turn within 60ft. of the Edge Stalker they must succeed a DC 18 Wisdom save or take 11 (2d10) psychic damage. In addition all creatures within the radius have disadvantage on all saving throws. <br> - The edge stalker regains hit points equal to half of the psychic damage it deals up to a maximum of 20 per turn. <br> Bladestorm <br> - When a creature makes a melee attack against the Edge Stalker they must succeed a DC 18 Dexterity check or fail the attack automatically. <br> - When the Edge Stalker deals damage with an attack the creature loses an additional 5(1d10) hitpoints at the start of each of their turns due to blood loss. The creature can use its action to attempt a DC 18 Constitution check, ending the effect on a success. <br> Pinpoint Precision <br> - The Edge Stalker gains +5 to hit when making attacks and crits on rolls of 18 - 20 <br> - When the Edge Stalker makes an attack it ignores disadvantage caused by range, if a creature is hit by an attack the creature must succeed a DC 18 constitution save or become incapacitated. The creature can remake this save at the end of each turn, ending the effect on a success. A creature that has succeeded the save within the last 24 hours is stunned instead of incapacitated."
