  desc: "While the Avatar is summoned, it radiates a destructive aura in a 120-foot radius. This aura has the following effects: <br> - Flame of anarchy. At the start of each of the Avatar's turns, creatures of its choice within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or take 21 (6d6) fire damage. Objects and structures in the area take double damage. <br> - Unpredictable Carnage. When a creature takes damage from the Avatar's aura or its attacks, roll a d6 to determine an additional random damage type (fire, force, psychic, lightning, thunder, or acid). The damage dealt equals 10 (3d6). <br> - Chaotic Influence. Creatures within the area must subtract 1d6 from all saving throws they make, as Carl's unpredictable power erodes their focus. <br> When the Avatar dissipates, it leaves behind a 60-foot radius area of chaotic flame that lingers for 1 hour. Creatures that enter the area or end their turn within it must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (4d10) fire damage."
