  desc: "While the Avatar is summoned, it radiates a destructive aura in a 120-foot radius. This aura has the following effects: <br> - Flame of anarchy. At the start of each of the Avatar's turns, creatures of its choice within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or take 21 (6d6) fire damage. Objects and structures in the area take double damage. <br> - Unpredictable Carnage. When a creature takes damage from the Avatar's aura or its attacks, roll a d6 to determine an additional random damage type (fire, force, psychic, lightning, thunder, or acid). The damage dealt equals 10 (3d6). <br> - Chaotic Influence. Creatures within the area must subtract 1d6 from all saving throws they make, as Carl's unpredictable power erodes their focus. <br> When the Avatar is reduced to 0 hit points or its summoning ends, it dissipates, leaving behind a 60-foot radius area of chaotic flame that lingers for 1 hour. Creatures that enter the area or end their turn within it must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (4d10) fire damage."

The fire extinguishes after 1 minute. <br> Rage of the Flame. The Avatar deals an additional 10 fire damage on all attacks. <br> 3. Flame Shield. Any creature that hits the Avatar with a melee attack takes 16 (3d10) fire damage. <br> 4. Wildfire Pulse. The Avatar releases a burst of flame, dealing 27 (6d8) fire damage to all creatures within 20 feet. <br> 5. Chaotic Displacement.

### Description:
An Avatar of Carl is not a mere servant or messenger—it is the walking embodiment of annihilation. Born of Carl’s will, each Avatar exists only to bring ruin. Wherever it manifests, cities crumble, armies scatter, and kingdoms fall to ash. The very air around it warps with destructive energy, burning away both body and soul.

**Chaotic Forms.** Avatars take many forms, each one shaped by the whim of Carl’s chaotic essence. Some appear as armored fiends with blazing wings, others as hulking monstrosities clad in fire and shadow, but all are united by a single mark—the great warhammer of chaos that they wield in battle. This weapon is more than steel; it is a fragment of Carl’s divine fury, capable of shattering mountains and sundering magic.

**Heralds of Annihilation.** Avatars are summoned only in times of great upheaval—when entire nations draw Carl’s gaze, or when mortals dare to tamper with forbidden magics. Their arrival is not subtle. Storms of flame precede them, the ground cracks beneath their steps, and their destructive aura corrodes the will of even the bravest defenders. To stand before an Avatar is to stand against the will of destruction itself.

**Chaos Unbound.** No two Avatars fight alike. Their very essence is unstable, and each battle unleashes unpredictable bursts of carnage. Walls collapse without warning, allies are consumed by firestorms, and spells falter under waves of chaotic interference. Even seasoned heroes can find themselves undone by the Avatar’s shifting power, for Carl’s chaos is not bound by mortal law.

**Immortal Instruments.** Though powerful beyond reckoning, Avatars are not Carl himself. They are vessels, fragments of his infinite essence, unleashed upon the mortal world to enforce his creed of destruction. They do not rest, they do not retreat, and they do not bargain. They exist for one purpose only: to break.

**Fiendish Nature.** Avatars of Carl do not require air, food, water, or sleep.
