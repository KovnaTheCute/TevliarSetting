At the start of each creature’s turn within the aura, it must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) psychic damage as it feels an insatiable hunger overwhelm it. <br> - Satiation Denied. Creatures cannot regain hit points while within the aura unless they succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw. <br> - Endless Hunger. At the start of each of the Avatar’s turns, it regains 20 hit points for each creature within the aura. <br> When the Avatar is reduced to 0 hit points or its summoning ends, it dissipates, leaving behind a blighted 30-foot-radius area of hunger that remains for 1 hour. Creatures in this area have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws and cannot regain hit points by any means."

### Description:
Avatars of Chomp are nightmarish echoes of the Feasting God’s fall from divinity. Once a primordial beast whose endless appetite threatened to consume creation itself, Chomp was bound and cursed by divine hands. Its mouth was sewn shut with threads of fate, denying it the feast it craved and twisting its divinity into something new: hunger without end.

These Avatars manifest as enormous, bloated aberrations, their swollen forms quivering with grotesque strength. Where their mouths should open, jagged scars and black stitches remain, radiating a curse that denies all satisfaction. Their eyes burn with desperation and rage, and their claws rip and tear not to eat, but to feed their curse through essence and soul.

**Embodiments of Starvation.** Wherever an Avatar of Chomp treads, mortals feel their stomachs knot with unbearable craving, their strength sapped by the gnawing void in their bellies. Food rots in its presence, drink turns to ash, and even magic that would restore life falters before the curse of hunger.

**The Sealed Maw.** Bound by divine decree, Avatars of Chomp can never sate themselves, even when they consume. Instead, they feed by tearing away fragments of vitality and essence from the living, absorbing what sustains others to prolong their own cursed existence. The more creatures suffer near them, the stronger the Avatar becomes.

**Agents of Desperation.** Avatars of Chomp are not summoned lightly; they often arise during times of famine, desperation, or great imbalance in the world. To some, they are omens of doom. To others, they are dark patrons who teach mortals that survival is not about feasting but about enduring the endless ache of want.

**Otherworldly Nature.** Avatars of Chomp do not require air, food, water, or sleep.
