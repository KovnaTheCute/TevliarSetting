- name: Multiple Heads.
  desc: "The Demonic Hydra has five heads. While it has more than one head, the Demonic Hydra has advantage on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious. Whenever the Demonic Hydra takes 45 or more damage in a single turn, one of its heads dies. If all the heads die, the Demonic Hydra dies. At the end of its turn it regrows three heads for each head that died since its last turn, unless it has taken radiant damage since its last turn. The Hydra regains 30 hit points for each head regrown this way."

### Description:
A Demonic Hydra is a terrifying abyssal variant of the common hydra, twisted beyond recognition by prolonged exposure to the corrupting essence of the Abyss. Its scaly flesh is charred and blackened, its many heads crowned with jagged horns that burn with inner fire. Where an ordinary hydra is a dangerous predator, a Demonic Hydra is a catastrophe — a living engine of destruction whose regenerative powers have been accelerated to grotesque extremes.

**Spawn of the Abyss.** Hydras that dwell too close to rifts into the Abyss or are deliberately warped by demonic rituals eventually undergo a nightmarish transformation. Their blood burns with hellfire, their jaws drip with molten venom, and their regeneration becomes unchecked, sprouting multiple heads at a horrific pace. Unlike their natural cousins, Demonic Hydras rarely hunt alone, for demons and sometimes even devils prize them as living weapons.

**Overcharged Regeneration.** The Demonic Hydra’s resilience borders on the impossible. Even severed heads are quickly replaced, and each rebirth leaves the beast stronger than before. Only radiant energy can suppress this frenzied healing, making divine magic one of the few reliable weapons against it.

**Beasts, Not Masters.** Despite their corruption, Demonic Hydras remain as beastial as their natural kin. They know nothing of tactics beyond overwhelming force and fire, hurling themselves at prey with blind rage. Still, when leashed by powerful demons or bound through infernal compacts, these monstrosities serve as terrifying siege engines, capable of scattering armies and reducing fortresses to ash.

**DM Note:**
The Demonic Hydra is a brutal, high-tier threat best used as either a centerpiece encounter or the terrifying guardian of an abyssal incursion. Its overwhelming health pool, rapid regeneration, and multiheaded fury make it an attrition nightmare if the party doesn’t have access to radiant damage.

When running the hydra, lean into its beastial nature: it doesn’t retreat, doesn’t scheme, and doesn’t stop until everything nearby is ash. This makes it excellent for large-scale battles where its presence turns the tide — such as a fiendish horde crashing against the walls of a city, or a devil unleashing it as a siege beast.
