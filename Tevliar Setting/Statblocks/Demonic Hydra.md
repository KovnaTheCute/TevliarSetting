  desc: "The Demonic Hydra has five heads. While it has more than one head, the Demonic Hydra has advantage on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious. Whenever the Demonic Hydra takes 60 or more damage in a single turn, one of its heads dies. If all the heads die, the Demonic Hydra dies. At the end of its turn it regrows three heads for each head that died since its last turn, unless it has taken radiant damage since its last turn. The Hydra regains 30 hit points for each head regrown this way."
