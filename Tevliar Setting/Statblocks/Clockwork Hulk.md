### Description:
The **Clockwork Hulk** is a squat, heavy-built automaton of brass and steel, its body driven by the rhythmic hiss of pressurized steam. Designed by the dwarves of Harma to perform backbreaking labor, these machines embody brute strength and tireless obedience. Inside their chest cavities lies a sealed boiler housing a bound steam spirit, its endless fury harnessed to turn gears, pistons, and turbines. The result is a creature of remarkable endurance—and terrible simplicity.

**Engines of Industry:** Clockwork Hulks were created to lift ore, haul machinery, and work the furnaces of Harma’s subterranean forges. Each one is painstakingly crafted from layered dwarven steel, engraved with rune-circuits that channel the power of the bound elemental within. Though incapable of thought or emotion, they are eerily lifelike when working—grunting from steam vents, exhaling bursts of vapor, and stomping through tunnels like living engines.

**The Burden of Obedience:** A Hulk does not think—it obeys. It interprets its commands literally and without hesitation. Many tragic tales tell of dwarves crushed under collapsed tunnels when their constructs dutifully continued mining after being told to “dig until the vein is gone.” Even a simple misphrasing can turn a Clockwork Hulk into an unstoppable hazard, carrying out a task until its gears grind to dust. The dwarves of Harma are meticulous in their phrasing for this reason, and it is said that every dwarven engineer learns early: _“The Hulk hears only what you say, never what you mean.”_

**Runaway Machines:** Without active supervision, Clockwork Hulks can become dangerous relics of abandoned worksites. As their orders persist indefinitely, a forgotten Hulk might still wander the tunnels centuries later, endlessly moving rocks, shoveling slag, or defending a long-collapsed forge from imagined intruders. In some rare cases, the steam spirit within grows restless, seizing partial control and transforming the construct into a mindless rampager—an accident that has ended more than one dwarven expedition.

**DM Notes:**
Clockwork Hulks work best as environmental encounters or early dungeon guardians rather than deliberate enemies. They can turn a mining site, ancient forge, or factory ruin into a perilous arena full of thudding footsteps and hissing vents. Since they’re not malevolent—just literal-minded—they’re ideal for moral puzzles and creative solutions: can the players find a way to _reword_ a Hulk’s command or deactivate it without destruction?

For low-level adventurers, a single Hulk provides a satisfying brute fight with environmental flavor. For higher-level parties, multiple Hulks can act as hazard control or siege engines, holding doors or breaking through walls under the command of a more intelligent overseer. If you tie them to dwarven engineering culture in Harma, they also make excellent symbols of the dwarves’ tragic mix of ingenuity and arrogance—creations meant to serve that, through their blind obedience, mirror the dangers of their makers’ perfectionism.
