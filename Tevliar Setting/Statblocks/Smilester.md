### Description:


**Lair Actions**
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Smilester takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:
- The Smilester's lair shifts and warps, causing all creatures within 60 feet to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute.
- The Smilester creates illusory duplicates of itself within its lair. These duplicates have the same statistics as the Smilester and last until the end of the Smilester's next turn. The duplicates can move and take actions independently, but they cannot attack. Any creature that targets the Smilester with an attack or harmful spell must first succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to determine which is the real Smilester.
- The Smilester creates an illusory maze within its lair. All creatures within the lair must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or have disadvantage on all skill checks, saving throws, and attack rolls for 1 minute. An afflicted creature can repeat the saved throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

- When within one mile of the smilesters lair, creatures may notice shadowy figures lurking just outside of their visions, getting worse the closer the creature gets to the lair. When inside the lair shadows move across creatures' visions, stalking and taunting them.
