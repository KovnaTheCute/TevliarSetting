  desc: "While the Avatar is summoned, it radiates a life-giving aura in a 120-foot radius, embodying McMuffin’s benevolent power. This aura has the following effects: <br> - Fertile Growth. Creatures of the Avatar's choice within the aura gain 15 temporary hit points at the start of their turn. Plants within the aura grow wildly, creating difficult terrain. <br> - Bountiful Harvest. All healing abilities cast within the aura affect all creatures of the Avatars choice within the aura instead of just one target. Creatures healed this way regain an additional 15 hit points. <br> - Plentiful Nourishment. Allies starting their turn within the aura gain advantage on saving throws against exhaustion, poison, and disease as the Avatar nourishes their bodies. <br> When the Avatar is reduced to 0 hit points or its summoning ends, it dissipates, leaving behind a 120-foot-radius area of verdant overgrowth that remains for 1 hour. The area becomes difficult terrain and creatures regain 10 hit points when starting their turn in the area."

### Description:
Avatars of John McMuffin appear as towering scarecrow-like constructs, woven from golden straw, wooden beams, and bound together by the divine spark of their patron. Despite their rustic form, they radiate immense vitality, carrying the scent of fertile soil and ripe harvests wherever they tread.

**The New Harvester.** John McMuffin is among the youngest gods of the pantheon, and his Avatars embody his simple but profound dominion over agriculture. Though weaker than the greater deities, these Avatars command the essence of life itself, channeling growth, nourishment, and renewal into the world. They are walking harvests, every step scattering the seeds of prosperity—or unleashing wrath when fields are threatened.

**Guardians of the Crop.** To see an Avatar of McMuffin is rare, and almost always heralds a turning point for mortals. In times of famine, villages blessed by their presence may see fields spring forth overnight, rivers flow with new abundance, and hunger banished within weeks. Yet when fields are defiled, burned, or neglected, the Avatars rise in anger, their scythes cutting down those who would destroy what sustains all life.

**Living Harvest.** The Avatars’ very bodies glow with radiant energy. Straw bursts into golden embers when struck, lighting the land like a beacon of divine renewal. Their touch can sow life into barren earth, heal the injured, or bind foes with roots and vines. They are both gentle gardeners and unstoppable reapers, reflecting McMuffin’s dual nature as nurturer and protector.

**Construct Nature.** Avatars of John McMuffin are divine constructs given life only by their god’s will. They do not eat, drink, sleep, or breathe.
