### Description:
The Avatars of Cesus Dhist appear not as warriors of radiant might, but as frail, soft-spoken old men garbed in flowing robes of light. Their forms radiate serenity, and their voices carry the weight of eternal compassion. They do not wield weapons, for their presence alone heals wounds, calms strife, and stills violence.

**Living Peace.** Where an Avatar treads, battle slows, bloodshed halts, and despair lifts. Those who stand near them feel the crushing weight of conflict dissolve into stillness. Blades falter in trembling hands, tears of pain dry, and even the dying breathe once more. The aura of Cesus Dhist’s Avatars is said to be so powerful that entire battlefields have fallen silent at their arrival, with thousands laying down their arms without a word.

**Unshakable Calm.** Unlike the fiery champions of other gods, the Avatars of Cesus Dhist remain calm even in the face of destruction. They walk unharmed through storms of fire and shadow, their robes unburnt, their steps never faltering. To the faithful, they are a living reminder that peace is not weakness, but a force stronger than steel. To their foes, they are an unbearable paradox: an enemy who refuses to hate, even as they are struck.

**Rare Summonings.** Cesus Dhist does not send Avatars lightly. Their presence marks moments of dire need, when whole nations stand on the brink of ruin, or when mercy must triumph over vengeance. They are often mistaken for ordinary elders until their divine aura sweeps across the land, revealing them as harbingers of salvation.

**The Price of Mercy.** Though the Avatars wield no malice, they are not harmless. Their pacifying presence robs fiends, undead, and other malign beings of their will to fight. Those who persist in striking against them find their hatred smothered by divine peace, until their weapons fall uselessly from their hands. Avatars of Cesus Dhist are not conquerors, but no army has ever been able to resist them for long.

**Celestial Nature.** Avatars of Cesus Dhist do not require air, food, water, or sleep.
