### Description:
Avatars of Garfield, the God of Nature, manifest as immense plesiosaurs, their long necks and sinuous bodies moving with both the majesty of oceans and the authority of untamed wilderness. Their scales shimmer with shifting hues of green and blue, like sunlight dappling through forest canopies or waves over coral reefs. Their eyes glow with a steady, verdant light, embodying the eternal balance of growth and decay, predator and prey, life and death.

**Primordial Guardians.** Garfield is one of the oldest gods of Tevliar, a primordial entity that embodies the totality of nature—savage, serene, nourishing, and merciless. Its Avatars carry this legacy, gliding through the skies as easily as if they were swimming through water. Wherever they pass, plants bloom, beasts rally, and the natural world stirs as if in recognition of its master.

**Balance in All Things.** The Avatars of Garfield are neither wholly kind nor cruel. They heal as easily as they poison, defend as readily as they destroy. To them, every beast, plant, and mortal is a thread in nature’s weave—those who respect it are nurtured, while those who defy it are swiftly consumed by its wrath.

**Summoners of the Wild.** When called into being, these Avatars often arrive heralded by storms, earthquakes, or sudden growth of wild flora. Animals of every kind flock to their presence, not as servants, but as kin answering an ancient call. In battle, their very roars summon packs of wolves, flocks of eagles, and swarms of beasts, fighting alongside the Avatar to restore the balance of their god’s domain.

**Harbingers of Renewal.** Even when destroyed, an Avatar of Garfield does not vanish in silence. Its death leaves behind a surge of natural rebirth—a sudden eruption of tangled forests, prowling animals, and surging rivers. For a time, the land it dies upon becomes a sanctuary of unrestrained life, both beautiful and perilous, until balance is restored once more.

**Primordial Nature.** Avatars of Chomp do not require air, food, water, or sleep.
