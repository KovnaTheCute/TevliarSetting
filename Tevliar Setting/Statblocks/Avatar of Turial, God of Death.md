  desc: "While the Avatar is summoned, it radiates a deadly aura in a 120-foot radius, embodying Turial’s necrotic power. This aura has the following effects: <br> - Necrotic Aura. At the start of each of the Avatar’s turns, all creatures of its choice within 30 feet must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or take 21 (6d6) necrotic damage. Undead creatures in the aura gain advantage on attack rolls and saving throws. <br> - Reaper’s Dominion. When the Avatar reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it absorbs their soul, preventing resurrection unless a wish spell is used until the Avatar dissipates. The slain creature rises immediately as a zombie under the Avatar's control. <br> - Dreadful Presence. Creatures of the Avatar’s choice within the aura must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw at the start of their turns or be frightened until the end of their next turn. <br> When the Avatar is reduced to 0 hit points or its summoning ends,it dissipates, it leaves behind a 30-foot-radius area of necrotic energy that lingers for 1 hour. Any creature entering this area takes 36 (8d8) necrotic damage, while undead regain 36 hit points at the start of their turns within the area."
