Poisoned creatures take 14 (4d6) poison damage at the start of their turns. <br> - Contagious Adaptation. Any creature within the aura that suffers from a disease gains advantage on Constitution saving throws and regenerates 10 hit points at the start of their turns. <br> When the Avatar is reduced to 0 hit points or its summoning ends, it dissipates, leaving behind a 60-foot-radius miasma that lingers for 1 hour.
