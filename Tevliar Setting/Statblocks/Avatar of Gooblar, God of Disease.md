### Description:
Avatars of Gooblar, the God of Disease, are revolting mountains of corrupted flesh, their forms swollen with pus, tumors, and writhing infestations. Their sagging bodies split open with every movement, releasing streams of bile, clouds of buzzing flies, and choking waves of noxious miasma. Their grotesque forms are never stable—one might drip with fungal growths while another crawls with worms and leeches, but all radiate the same aura of pestilence and inevitability.

**Incarnations of Decay.** Gooblar’s Avatars embody the paradox of disease: death and suffering intertwined with renewal and adaptation. Where they walk, crops wither and rot, rivers turn brackish, and beasts stagger in fever—yet survivors often emerge stronger, carrying strange immunities or mutations that ripple through future generations.

**Alien Mercy.** These Avatars do not hate mortals, nor do they seek to destroy them outright. To Gooblar, illness is a gift, a trial that separates the weak from the strong. An Avatar may just as readily cure a victim as infect them, only to watch the cycle of affliction and recovery continue. Their laughter is a bubbling, phlegm-ridden sound that echoes with both mockery and strange, paternal pride.

**Heralds of Pestilence.** Their presence alone heralds catastrophe. Fields collapse into sludge, vermin breed unchecked, and mortals fall ill by the thousands. Armies falter before them, not by blade or flame, but through fever and coughing fits that strip away their resolve. Yet wherever one of these Avatars falls, the land itself transforms—choked with pestilent growths, yes, but also blossoming into strange ecosystems teeming with mutated flora and resilient fauna.

**The Cycle of Sickness.** Above all else, the Avatar embodies Gooblar’s greatest truth: every affliction has its place. Sickness leads to death, death leads to renewal, and renewal strengthens life. To encounter an Avatar of Gooblar is to stand before the very engine of entropy and rebirth, wrapped in flesh, rot, and plague.

**Primordial Nature.** Avatar's of Gooblar do not require air, food, water, or sleep.
