### Description:
Avatars of Gooblar, the God of Disease, are revolting mountains of corrupted flesh, their forms swollen with pus, tumors, and writhing infestations. Their sagging bodies split open with every movement, releasing streams of bile, clouds of buzzing flies, and choking waves of noxious miasma. Their grotesque forms are never stable—one might drip with fungal growths while another crawls with worms and leeches, but all radiate the same aura of pestilence and inevitability.

**Incarnations of Decay.** Gooblar’s Avatars embody the paradox of disease: death and suffering intertwined with renewal and adaptation. Where they walk, crops wither and rot, rivers turn brackish, and beasts stagger in fever—yet survivors often emerge stronger, carrying strange immunities or mutations that ripple through future generations.

**Alien Mercy.** These Avatars do not hate mortals, nor do they seek to destroy them outright. To Gooblar, illness is a gift, a trial that separates the weak from the strong. An Avatar may just as readily cure a victim as infect them, only to watch the cycle of affliction and recovery continue. Their laughter is a bubbling, phlegm-ridden sound that echoes with both mockery and strange, paternal pride.

**Heralds of Pestilence.** Their presence alone heralds catastrophe. Fields collapse into sludge, vermin breed unchecked, and mortals fall ill by the thousands. Armies falter before them, not by blade or flame, but through fever and coughing fits that strip away their resolve. Yet wherever one of these Avatars falls, the land itself transforms—choked with pestilent growths, yes, but also blossoming into strange ecosystems teeming with mutated flora and resilient fauna.

**The Cycle of Sickness.** Above all else, the Avatar embodies Gooblar’s greatest truth: every affliction has its place. Sickness leads to death, death leads to renewal, and renewal strengthens life. To encounter an Avatar of Gooblar is to stand before the very engine of entropy and rebirth, wrapped in flesh, rot, and plague.

**Primordial Nature.** Avatar's of Gooblar do not require air, food, water, or sleep.

### Disease Descriptions

**Cackle Fever.** Victims burst into uncontrollable fits of laughter, often spitting blood between gasps. Whenever they are under stress—such as in combat or casting a spell—they must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become incapacitated with laughter until the start of their next turn. This fever lasts 1d10 days unless cured.

**Sewer Plague.** A sickness that fills the body with fever, chills, and foul-smelling sores. Each long rest, the victim makes a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they gain 1 level of exhaustion; on a success, they recover 1 level instead. The disease persists until magically cured.

**Rotlung Fever.** The victim’s lungs fill with mucus and blood, making every breath painful. Their speed is halved, and they suffer disadvantage on Constitution saving throws. Each dawn, they must make a DC 14 Constitution save or take 1d8 necrotic damage.

**Wormskin.** Tiny parasites burrow beneath the flesh, writhing visibly under the skin. At the start of each turn in combat, the victim takes 1 piercing damage. They also suffer disadvantage on Charisma checks as their appearance grows increasingly disturbing.

**Pus Blight.** The body erupts in painful boils that ooze with yellow pus. Victims have disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. When they take slashing or piercing damage, pus sprays outward—creatures within 5 feet must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the end of their next turn.

**Blackrot.** A wasting infection that blackens and withers the flesh. Each dawn, the victim’s hit point maximum is reduced by 1d6. If reduced to 0 by this disease, they die and their body becomes host to fungal growths.

**Miretongue.** The tongue swells grotesquely, splitting and dripping green mucus. The victim cannot speak clearly; verbal spell components require a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to succeed. They also suffer disadvantage on Persuasion checks.

**Slimeflux.** The stomach overproduces corrosive bile, forcing the victim to vomit acid at random. Each short or long rest, they must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 acid damage. If they fail, they gain advantage on their next saving throw against disease.

**Creeping Chill.** The body shakes violently under a feverish chill, leaving the victim drenched in cold sweat. Their speed is reduced by 10 feet, and they suffer disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity ability checks.

**Boneplague.** A disease that hollows the bones, leaving them brittle. Victims gain vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. In addition, any damage taken from falling is doubled.

**Blister Veins.** Veins swell and glow red-hot as the body overheats. At the start of each of their turns in combat, the victim must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 fire damage.

**Grubflesh.** Fat, pale larvae squirm beneath the skin, eating away at muscle tissue. Each dawn, the victim permanently loses 1d4 Strength unless cured. A creature reduced to Strength 0 dies as their body collapses into a mass of writhing grubs.
