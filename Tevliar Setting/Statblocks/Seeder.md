  desc: "When the death rattle seeds land on a surface, they embed themselves and grow into new death rattles. After 1d4 hours, a new death rattle sprouts from the surface. If they embed themselves into a creature they take root and upon the creature's death it turns the corpse into a seeder after 1d4 hours. The seeds can be removed with greater restoration, heal, or Wish."
