  desc: "When the death rattle seeds land on a surface, they embed themselves and grow into new death rattles. After 1d4 hours, a new death rattle sprouts from the surface. If they embed themselves into a creature they take root and upon the creature's death it turns the corpse into a seeder after 1d4 hours. The seeds can be removed with greater restoration, heal, or Wish."
- name: Deadly Demise.
  desc: "When the seeder is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes in a burst of shrapnel-like spores. Each creature within 15 feet of the seeder must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one."

  desc: The seeder makes two vine attacks or one vine attack and exploding bulb.
- name: Vine Attack.
  desc: "Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be grappled (escape DC 12). While grappled, the target is restrained, and the seeder can't use the same vine on another target."
- name: Exploding Bulb (Recharge 5-6).
  desc: "The seeder detonates one of the bulbs growing on its vines in a 10ft cone. Each creature within the cone must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The seeder also takes damage but automatically succeeds on the save. Creatures that have been grappled by the seeder automatically fail their saving throw."
