The Barbeel can only have one target swallowed at a time. If the Barbeel dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 10ft of movement, exiting prone."

The Barbeel can retract any number of barbed spines as a bonus action pulling a grappled creature towards it by 30ft and dealing an additional 7 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage per spine in the creature."

### Description:
The Barbeel is a nightmare of the abyss — a long, eel-like predator with rows of jagged teeth and a gaping maw capable of swallowing prey whole. Running along its back are two serried lines of barbed, harpoon-like bones, each capable of launching from its flesh with explosive force. These spines impale victims at a distance before retracting to drag the helpless prey into the creature’s mouth.

**Ambush Predators.** Barbeels bury themselves beneath silt or hide within kelp forests, waiting motionless for vibrations in the water. When potential prey passes overhead, they unleash a flurry of barbs, skewering and reeling in their victim. Their strikes are brutally efficient — the spines anchor deep, tearing flesh as they reel in the catch. Once the prey is close enough, the Barbeel swallows it whole, letting its corrosive stomach acids finish the job.

**Digestive Horrors.** Few creatures experience a death as horrific as being swallowed by a Barbeel. Its stomach is a churning pit of acid and pressure, where still-living victims dissolve over several agonizing moments. Sailors speak of strange bubbles rising from the depths where Barbeels feed — the last screams of the devoured escaping through the water.

**Silent Hunters.** Despite their brutality, Barbeels are not mindless killers. They attack with deliberate precision, often waiting until prey is isolated or exhausted. When sated, they retreat to underwater caves or shipwrecks, where their molted spines form sinister decorations among the bones of past meals.

**DM’s Notes:**
The Barbeel is an ideal ambush predator for aquatic campaigns or coastal encounters. Its ranged harpoon attacks make it a unique and terrifying underwater threat, capable of grappling characters from afar before dragging them into melee range to be swallowed. Smart use of terrain — murky waters, wreckage, or coral forests — amplifies its lethality.
