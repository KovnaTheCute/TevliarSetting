### Description:
These massive crustaceans are rare mutations of the ordinary giant crab, swollen to unnatural proportions by ancient magic, unstable alchemy, or years of thriving in magically enriched waters. Their shells are thick as iron and patterned with strange hues — deep blues, sickly greens, and streaks of violet or crimson that shimmer under torchlight. Beneath their carapaces, muscles ripple with unnatural density, allowing them to crush bone and dent metal with ease.

**Relics of the Deep.** In coastal folklore, abnormally giant crabs are sometimes called “reef wardens” or “tide hulks.” Many sailors believe them to be the guardians of drowned ruins or the servants of forgotten sea gods. They are drawn to the vibrations of movement and sound in shallow waters, attacking anything large enough to be perceived as a rival or a threat. In rare cases, they are found inland — survivors of ancient floods or magical contamination that has driven them into swamps and estuaries.

**Hunters of Territory, Not Prey.** Despite their monstrous size, these crabs rarely hunt for food; they scavenge from the sea floor, consuming carrion and seaweed. Their aggression stems from territorial instinct rather than hunger. Anything that enters their claimed domain — whether ship, shark, or shoreline settlement — risks being seized in their crushing claws and dragged into the depths.

**DM’s Notes:**
An abnormally giant crab can serve as a formidable early-game boss or environmental guardian, especially in seaside or sunken ruins. Their natural armor and grappling abilities make them dangerous in close combat, particularly when used alongside rough terrain or water hazards. For added flavor, consider variant types — glowing abyssal crabs that emit bioluminescent light, volcanic crabs with steaming shells, or ones mutated by alchemy into amphibious siege beasts.
