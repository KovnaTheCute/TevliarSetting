### Description:
Grafted zombies are crude amalgamations of corpses, stitched together with rough thread, wire, and necrotic energy. They are often the first attempts of an apprentice necromancer experimenting with reanimation and bodily fusion — patchwork horrors made from whatever remains could be scavenged from graves, battlefields, or morgues. Their limbs rarely match, their torsos are bloated with decay, and their skin hangs loose where the stitching has failed to take.

**A Mockery of Life.** These abominations are animated not through refined ritual but through brute force — necromantic energy violently forced into mismatched flesh. The result is unstable, twitching, and unpredictable. When idle, a grafted zombie’s limbs may spasm independently, as if each piece still remembers the life it once lived. Some even mutter incoherently with multiple half-formed mouths, though none can form true words.

**Useful, Disposable, and Easily Replaced.** To a necromancer, grafted zombies are expendable servants, perfect for testing new spells or guarding tombs too unimportant for stronger undead. They are slow and clumsy, but their thick, malformed bodies can withstand significant punishment before collapsing into a heap of mismatched limbs. When destroyed, a grafted zombie’s remains often continue twitching for several minutes, a grim reminder of the necromancer’s imperfect art.

**DM’s Notes:**
Grafted zombies are best used to show a necromancer’s growing skill — a step above mindless undead but far below abominations like flesh golems. They work well as low-level brutes or guardians in a necromantic workshop, and clever necromancers might fuse additional parts or enchantments into them for unique variants (extra limbs, animal heads, or alchemical enhancements).
