  desc: "The Twisted Abomination absorbs the essence of a creature it has killed. This destroys the slain creature's soul and physical form as they are both consumed by the abomination. The following effects take place immediately: <br> - The abomination's size, armor class, hit dice, speed, strength, dexterity, constitution, senses, and proficiency bonus all increase to match the slain creature's base stats (If a creature is wearing armor the abominations stats increase according to the creatures base stats if they were not wearing armor). The abomination’s stats can not be decreased in this way. <br> - The abomination gains all traits and abilities that the slain creature had with exception of abilities provided by equipment or magic items. <br> - If the slain creature had an intelligence modifier that was higher than the abominations the abomination gains 1 point in intelligence and 1 point in charisma. <br> - If the abomination has an intelligence of 8 or greater it gains any languages the slain creature spoke, if the abominations intelligence is below 10 its language is broken and difficult to understand. <br> - If the slain creature had biological weapons (i.e. claws, acid spit, etc) the twisted abomination gains these weapons. If the slain creature has a stronger version of an attack that the abomination already has (i.e. bite attack that does 2d6 damage instead of 1d4 or a an extra damage type that's added onto the attack like a bite that does 1d4 acid in addition to its piercing) the abominations attack is replaced by the stronger attack. <br> - If the slain creature had a multiattack that is higher than the abomination's multiattack (Higher meaning more total attacks) the abomination replaces its multiattack with that of the slain creature. The abomination can use any combination of melee and ranged attacks in its multiattack however it can not use actions that have a recharge, or are abilities that would not normally be involved in multiattack. <br> - The abomination’s CR changes as it consumes creatures. Each time a new creature is consumed (i.e. the abomination’s statblock changes) the slain creature’s xp is added to the abomination’s xp worth (normally determined by CR). The abomination’s CR changes when the XP reaches a new CR value. (i.e. CR1/8 = 25xp and CR1/4 is 50xp. Once the abomination has an xp value of 50 its cr changes) <br> - The abomination also gains any legendary actions, bonus actions, and reactions the slain creature had. The abomination does not get lair actions or lair effects. <br> - The abomination takes a hybrid appearance of all the creatures it has consumed. Its body morphs when using specific abilities and traits so that it may use these traits. (i.e. if it uses a bite attack it morphs a mouth, or if it uses armored plating it shifts to have armored plating). Passive traits such as natural armor are always present in its form. <br> - The abomination regains hitpoints equal to half the slain creatures max hitpoints. <br> - Creatures slain and absorbed by the abomination can not be revived by any means short of a wish spell."

  desc: "When the abomination hits a creature with an attack, the creature may not regain hit points until the start of the abomination's next turn.
