  desc: "The Twisting Abomination absorbs the essence of a creature it has killed. This destroys the slain creature's soul and physical form as they are both consumed by the abomination. The following effects take place immediately: <br> - The abomination's size, armor class, hit dice, speed, strength, dexterity, constitution, senses, and proficiency bonus all increase to match the slain creature's base stats (If a creature is wearing armor the abominations stats increase according to the creatures base stats if they were not wearing armor). The abomination’s stats can not be decreased in this way. <br> - The abomination gains all traits and abilities that the slain creature had with exception of abilities provided by equipment or magic items. <br> - If the slain creature had an intelligence modifier that was higher than the abominations the abomination gains 1 point in intelligence and 1 point in charisma. <br> - If the abomination has an intelligence of 8 or greater it gains any languages the slain creature spoke, if the abominations intelligence is below 10 its language is broken and difficult to understand. <br> - If the slain creature had biological weapons (i.e. claws, acid spit, etc) the twisted abomination gains these weapons. If the slain creature has a stronger version of an attack that the abomination already has (i.e. bite attack that does 2d6 damage instead of 1d4 or a an extra damage type that's added onto the attack like a bite that does 1d4 acid in addition to its piercing) the abominations attack is replaced by the stronger attack. <br> - If the slain creature had a multiattack that is higher than the abomination's multiattack (Higher meaning more total attacks) the abomination replaces its multiattack with that of the slain creature. The abomination can use any combination of melee and ranged attacks in its multiattack however it can not use actions that have a recharge, or are abilities that would not normally be involved in multiattack. <br> - The abomination’s CR changes as it consumes creatures. Each time a new creature is consumed (i.e. the abomination’s statblock changes) the slain creature’s xp is added to the abomination’s xp worth (normally determined by CR). The abomination’s CR changes when the XP reaches a new CR value. (i.e. CR1/8 = 25xp and CR1/4 is 50xp. Once the abomination has an xp value of 50 its cr changes) <br> - The abomination also gains any legendary actions, bonus actions, and reactions the slain creature had. The abomination does not get lair actions or lair effects. <br> - The abomination takes a hybrid appearance of all the creatures it has consumed. Its body morphs when using specific abilities and traits so that it may use these traits. (i.e. if it uses a bite attack it morphs a mouth, or if it uses armored plating it shifts to have armored plating). Passive traits such as natural armor are always present in its form. <br> - The abomination regains hitpoints equal to half the slain creatures max hitpoints. <br> - Creatures slain and absorbed by the abomination can not be revived by any means short of a wish spell."

### Description:
A Horror Born of Mana and Madness. Twisted Abominations are spawned only under the rarest of circumstances—when unstable mana coalesces into flesh, or when failed magical experiments fracture the boundary between life and monstrosity. What emerges is no longer a natural being, but a writhing horror whose body constantly shifts, reshapes, and contorts.

Endless Hunger. The Abomination’s sole instinct is to consume. It does not hunt for survival, nor for malice, but for an incomprehensible compulsion to absorb the essence of living beings. Every victim is unmade—body, mind, and soul—woven into the Abomination’s ever-changing form. The result is a creature that becomes stronger and stranger with every kill, a grotesque patchwork of features that no two observers describe the same way.

Evolving Nightmare. With each consumed creature, the Abomination mutates, gaining new powers and growing ever more deadly. The bones of beasts may jut from its limbs, the wings of birds may sprout from its back, or the claws of predators may slide from its hands. To face one is to battle every monster it has ever devoured, all at once.

Mad Intelligence. Though most Twisted Abominations remain mindless, a rare few survive long enough to grow a semblance of intelligence. These beings are not sane by any mortal measure—their thoughts are fractured, alien, and terrifyingly unpredictable. Their intelligence, when it manifests, only serves to make them more dangerous, for an Abomination with cunning can plot, plan, and stalk its prey like a predator wearing a dozen skins.

Irredeemable Horror. The essence of those consumed by a Twisted Abomination is utterly annihilated. Not even the most powerful divine intervention short of a wish can restore what is lost. To most scholars and priests, these creatures are not living beings but a corruption of magic itself—abominations that should never have existed, and which must be destroyed at any cost.
