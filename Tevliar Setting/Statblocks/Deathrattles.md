### Description:
Death Rattles are invasive fungal horrors that spread by detonating volatile bulbs growing along their flesh-red stalks. When ruptured, these bulbs explode in a spray of jagged spores that embed themselves into flesh, wood, or stone, where they take root and rapidly grow new stalks. Over time, entire caverns or battlefields can become overrun with these grotesque fungi, turning once-living ecosystems into fields of pulsing, spore-filled death.

**Fungal Shrapnel.** Each Death Rattle bears clusters of swollen bulbs along its stalks, each filled with razor-edged spore fragments. When disturbed, threatened, or mature enough to rupture, the bulbs explode in a localized blast, scattering spores like jagged shrapnel. These spores embed themselves in whatever they strike, whether soil, corpses, or living flesh.

**Parasitic Growth.** Spores that implant into living creatures are particularly insidious. Though often unnoticed at first, they grow quietly within muscle and bone until the host eventually dies—at which point the corpse becomes a fertile “seeder.” Within hours, new stalks sprout from the body, bursting outward in grotesque blooms of red fungal growth.

**Invasive Ecosystem.** Death Rattles cannot be reasoned with, bargained with, or even truly destroyed without fire or magic. Even a single overlooked spore can spread, creating a new cluster within hours. Left unchecked, these horrors can overrun villages, forests, or dungeons, leaving nothing behind but fungal wastelands teeming with spore-filled husks.
