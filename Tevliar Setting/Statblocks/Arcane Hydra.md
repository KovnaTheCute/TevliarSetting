  desc: "The Arcane Hydra has seven heads. It can make a number of bite attacks equal to the number of heads it has. If the hydra takes 40 damage in one turn then a head dies. The Hydra can regrow all lost heads at the start of its next turn unless it’s under the effect of an anti-magic field. When a head is regrown the Hydra releases a burst of magical energy dealing 44 (10d8) force damage to all creatures within 10 ft of it per head grown back."

  desc: "Each head has a different spell associated to it as follows: <br> - Red Head (Evocation): Fireball. A bright streak flashes from the Arcane Hydras mouth to a point it chooses in range and blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each Creature in a 20ft radius must make a DC 19 DEX saving throw. A target takes 35 (10d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. <br><br> - Blue Head (Enchantment): Dissonant Whispers. The Arcane Hydra whispers a discordant melody that only one creature of its choice within range can hear, wracking it with terrible pain. The target must make a DC 19 WIS saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 24 (7d6) psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from the arcane hydra. The creature doesn’t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn’t have to move away. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save. <br><br> - Green Head (Necromancy): Blight. Necromantic energy washes over a creature of the hydras choice that it can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a DC 19 CON saving throw. The target takes 40 (9d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs. If the hydra targets a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it. If the hydra targets a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn't make a saving throw, it simply withers and dies. <br><br> - Purple Head (Transmutation): Magnify gravity. The gravity in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the Arcane Hydra can see within range increases for a moment. Each creature in the sphere on the turn when it casts the spell must make a DC 19 CON saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 27 (6d8) force damage, and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and suffers no reduction to its speed. <br> - Black Head (Illusion): Fear. The arcane Hydra projects a phantasmal image of a creature’s worst fears. Each creature in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or use their reaction to use all their movement moving away from the arcane hydra by the safest available route. <br> - White Head (Abjuration): Dispel Magic. The Arcane Hydra chooses one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any spell of 5th level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 6th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability (+9). The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, the spell ends. <br> - Yellow Head (Conjuration): Misty Step. Briefly surrounded by silvery mist, The Arcane Hydra teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that it can see."
