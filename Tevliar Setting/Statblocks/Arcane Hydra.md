  desc: "The Arcane Hydra has seven heads. It can make a number of bite attacks equal to the number of heads it has. If the hydra takes 40 damage in one turn then a head dies. The Hydra can regrow all lost heads at the start of its next turn unless itâ€™s under the effect of an anti-magic field. When a head is regrown the Hydra releases a burst of magical energy dealing 44 (10d8) force damage to all creatures within 10 ft of it per head grown back."
