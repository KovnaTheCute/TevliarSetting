### Description:
Broad-shouldered and hulking, Sharkmen are amphibious raiders feared along coastlines and sea routes. Their gray, scarred flesh resists both blade and flame, and their jagged maws can shear through armor and bone alike. With webbed hands and feet, they swim with frightening speed and strike with primal efficiency, dragging their victims into the waves.

**Brutal and Bloodthirsty.** A Sharkman’s world is one of dominance and blood. Strength is the only law they recognize, and the weak are either enslaved or devoured. Their hunger for flesh is not born of necessity alone—Sharkmen revel in the act of killing, and the scent of blood drives them into a frenzy that few creatures can withstand. When one among them falls, the others often tear into the corpse mid-battle, driven by instinct and cruelty in equal measure.

**Raiders of the Deep.** Sharkmen dwell in half-flooded caverns, coral citadels, and sunken ruins scattered across continental shelves. From these lairs, they launch swift, brutal raids on passing ships and coastal villages. Their attacks are often timed with the tide, striking when the surf conceals their approach. Victims rarely see the first glint of their eyes beneath the water before the slaughter begins. The Sharkmen drag their spoils—living and dead—back to the depths, leaving only crimson-stained foam in their wake.

**Hierarchies of Power.** Among the Sharkfolk, might makes rank. Those who prove themselves in battle rise quickly, earning the grudging respect of their kin. The most dominant of their kind, known as Elite Sharkmen, are both physically superior and tactically gifted. They command warbands of their lesser kin, coordinating ambushes and orchestrating devastating sea raids. These elites adorn themselves with trophies—shark teeth, humanoid bones, and the barnacle-encrusted jewelry of the drowned—to mark their status.

**Hunters of the Wounded.** A Sharkman’s keen senses are heightened by the smell of blood, which they can detect over vast distances underwater. Once a creature is wounded, escape becomes nearly impossible. Entire pods of Sharkmen will pursue a bleeding quarry relentlessly, their frenzy only ending when the last drop of blood disperses into the sea. This instinct makes them particularly dangerous in prolonged battles, as even the smallest injury can turn the tide in their favor.

**DM’s Note:**
Sharkmen thrive in encounters that blur the line between land and sea. Use them in shipboard battles, harbor raids, or coastal ambushes, where their swimming speed and blood frenzy can force players to adapt to unpredictable conditions. Standard Sharkmen excel as frontline attackers, while Elite Sharkmen serve as ruthless commanders who press every advantage. For maximum tension, stage battles in rising tides or aboard sinking ships—situations where their aquatic nature turns a skirmish into a desperate struggle for survival.
