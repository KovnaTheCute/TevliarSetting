### Description:
Raptagons are strange, serpentine dragons that slither through the murky swamps and bogs of the world. Unlike their larger, more majestic kin, Raptagons have only two clawed forelimbs and a long, muscular body that propels them through mud and water with uncanny grace. Their scales blend seamlessly with the green-gray muck of their environment, while the dull red membranes of their atrophied wings hint at their distant draconic heritage.

**Swamp Stalkers.** Patient and cunning, Raptagons are ambush predators that use the stagnant waters of their home to conceal their approach. Their six slit-pupiled eyes peer just above the surface as they wait for the perfect moment to strike. When prey draws near, they erupt from the water in a flash of teeth and claws, their packmates moving with frightening coordination.

**Primitive Intelligence.** Though capable of speech, Raptagons have little use for it beyond growls and hissing threats. Their minds are simple but not animalistic—they display pack hierarchies, cooperative hunting strategies, and even rudimentary territorial rituals. Some swamp-dwelling cults revere them as spirits of the mire, offering sacrifices to ensure safe passage through their domains.

**Small Wings, Fierce Spirits.** While their wings are too weak for sustained flight, Raptagons use them to glide between trees or lunge from the water’s edge. Despite their feral appearance, they are remarkably agile in the air, capable of swooping attacks and mid-air turns that leave their prey disoriented.

**DM Note:** Raptagons make excellent mid-level ambush predators or companions to swamp-based encounters. Their use of Pack Tactics and Flyby makes them dangerous in hit-and-run battles, especially in areas where movement is slowed by water or mud. Clever groups of Raptagons will retreat beneath the surface after attacking, forcing players to adapt to an unseen and mobile threat. You can emphasize their alien intelligence by having them coordinate ambushes or leave behind “offerings” of bones and trinkets to mark territory.
