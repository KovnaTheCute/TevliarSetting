### Description:
Kobold Defenders are unusual among their kin, encased in mismatched plate and burdened with tower-sized shields forged from scavenged metal scraps. Most kobolds lack the strength or skill to wield such protection effectively, but Defenders are trained from a young age to brace themselves as living bulwarks. They are rarely encountered outside their home tunnels, where narrow passages and choke points allow their forward-facing defense to shine.

**Living Barricades.** Defenders advance with ponderous steps, forming the first line of resistance against intruders. They lack the speed and cunning of other kobolds, but make up for it with sheer resilience and the ability to provide cover for allies. Often they will stand shoulder-to-shoulder at bottlenecks, presenting an impenetrable wall of iron and bone.

**Scrap and Salvage.** Their armor and shields are rarely uniform, instead patched together from battlefield debris, rusted helms, and hammered cookware. What they lack in craftsmanship, they make up for in determination, standing until they or their shield is broken. Other kobolds revere Defenders as stalwart guardians, often rewarding them with offerings of food, trinkets, or shiny bits of armor to reinforce their plating.

**DM’s Note:**
Kobold Defenders work best as obstacles in tight environments where players can’t easily maneuver around them. They aren’t deadly on their own, but their ability to provide cover and stall movement can make ordinary kobold ambushes far more dangerous. Place them in tunnel entrances, behind barricades, or in pairs guarding treasure hoards to force players into tactical decisions. They’re less effective in open ground, where faster foes can easily outflank them.
