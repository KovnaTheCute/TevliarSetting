### Description:
Rotting Watchers are pitiful undead servants—living conduits of a necromancer’s will and sight. Once humanoid, their eyes and mouths are sewn shut, leaving them blind and voiceless, stripped of any sense of self. Through grim ritual, their decaying flesh becomes a canvas for hundreds of new eyes, each carefully grafted and stitched into place by their creator. These eyes do not serve the watcher—they serve the master.

**Servants of Sight.** A rotting watcher acts as an extension of the necromancer who created it, wandering through catacombs, towns, and battlefields as an unwilling spy. The necromancer can see through the many eyes sewn into its rotted hide, granting them awareness far beyond their own body. The watcher itself perceives the world through sound and intuition, moving with a trembling awareness of its surroundings but never fully understanding what it perceives.

**Unending Pain.** Despite their obedience, rotting watchers suffer endlessly. Their bodies rot but do not die, every motion tearing old stitches and leaking necrotic fluids. Their minds are flooded with faint, broken visions from the necromancer’s borrowed sight—images that don’t belong to them. They rarely resist, having long since surrendered their will, though some retain a dim echo of hatred for the one who created them.

**A Tool, Not a Soldier.** While capable of defending themselves with unsettling grace, watchers are rarely sent into direct combat. Instead, they linger in shadows, eavesdropping and tracking the necromancer’s enemies. When cornered, they attack with vicious desperation, clawing and slashing not out of hatred—but because that is the only way they know how to exist.

**DM’s Note:**
Rotting Watchers are best used as eerie foreshadowing tools rather than direct threats. Encountering one suggests a necromancer’s presence nearby, perhaps watching the adventurers even now. Their unnerving appearance and tragic servitude can add a sense of dread to necromantic lairs or cursed ruins.

If the party captures a rotting watcher, communication is difficult but possible through magic. Revealing the watcher’s torment—and its inability to see despite its many eyes—can serve as a powerful moment of horror or pity, grounding the necromancer’s evil in something deeply personal.
