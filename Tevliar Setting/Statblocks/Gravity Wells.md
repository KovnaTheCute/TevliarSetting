- name: Reality Warping Aura.
  desc: "The presence of the Gravity Wells creates a 10-foot radius of warped reality. This area is difficult terrain, and any creature that starts its turn within this area must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success."

  desc: "Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (6d6) force damage, and if the target is Medium or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled 10 feet towards the swarm and be restrained until the end of its next turn."
- name: Gravity Well (Recharge 5-6).
  desc: "The Gravity Wells expel intense quantities of gravitational force in a 10-foot radius sphere centered on themselves. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw or take 22 (4d10) force damage and be restrained until the end of its next turn. All creatures in the area become vulnerable to damage caused by falling."

### Description:
Gravity Wells are one of the most prolific pests of the Edge—the infinite void between universes where even gods dare not tread. At first glance, they appear as swarms of toothy, black motes clumped into whirling masses, their forms flickering in and out of universal reality. Unlike the towering Devourers of Gravity, the Wells lack dimensional tentacles, instead darting erratically as if gnawing at the fabric of existence itself.

**Predators of Mass.** Gravity Wells feed on the same “nutrient” as their kin: the mass and gravitational force inherent in matter. They do not simply consume flesh, stone, or metal—they consume the weight and pull that binds them together. A battlefield touched by Wells often collapses into surreal landscapes of drifting debris, as structures weaken and fall apart under their absence of gravity.

**Shifting Trails.** In their passage, Gravity Wells leave behind warping traces of space-time—shimmering distortions that fade in and out of reality. To mortal eyes, these trails appear like heat ripples or mirages, yet stepping through one can twist perception, direction, or even physical laws. Entire regions plagued by Wells become unstable, marked by falling upward, sideways rain, and fractured terrain that seems to breathe.

**Pests of the Edge.** Unlike their Great Devourer kin, Wells are not cunning or strategic. They are bestial swarms, hungering only for consumption. Still, their unpredictability makes them dangerous: a lone swarm may be survivable, but colonies drifting together have ended expeditions of gods and titans alike. They are one of the reasons the Edge is considered uninhabitable and untamable.

**DM Note:** Gravity Wells excel as chaotic environmental hazards or secondary antagonists in Edge-adjacent zones. They can act as persistent terrain threats, forcing PCs to rethink positioning, movement, and spell usage. Swarms of Wells work well in large-scale encounters where multiple hazards interact, such as near fractured planar rifts, collapsing dimensions, or contested objectives. Their movement patterns can be partially randomized, making the battlefield dynamic and dangerous, without requiring direct attacks each turn. Encourage players to manipulate the environment or use creative tactics to survive rather than brute force.
