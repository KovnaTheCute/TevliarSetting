  desc: "As Blentir fights, his power grows. At the end of each round, Blentir gains a Rage Counter (maximum 5). For every Rage Counter, his attack and damage rolls increase by +2. When he reaches 5 Rage Counters, Blentir enters a Berserk state, attacking the nearest creature with reckless abandon. In this state blentir gets advantage on all attacks and is immune to psychic damage. The berserk state ends when Blentir deals 0 damage to other creatures for 1 minute."
- name: Unholy Balance.
  desc: "Blentirâ€™s sickles are opposites, the shroud of despair being demonic in nature and the blade of devotion being devilish. If Blentir deals damage with the Shroud of Despair and the Blade of Devotion in the same round, he gains temporary hit points equal to the total damage dealt by both sickles."
- name: Relentless Endurance.
  desc: "When Blentir is reduced to 0 hit points, he can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or a save equal to the damage taken (Whichever is higher). On a success, he drops to 1 hit point instead."
